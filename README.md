# **AI-Enhanced Deterioration Simulation and Restoration Planning** 

**Project summary**
This project implements a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for simulating long-term physical deterioration of painted or decorated heritage elements (frescoes, panel paintings, illuminated manuscripts), producing a virtual restoration, and recommending a prioritized combined strategy of physical conservation and digital restoration. The system is agent-based, sequential, and designed for experimentation, scenario analysis, and decision support for conservators and collection managers.

**Project overview**

This MAS simulates environmental conditions over long time horizons, models material degradation using physical and chemical decay models, synthesizes digitally restored images using deep learning, models cost and effectiveness for physical interventions, and optimizes combined digital+physical strategies under constraints (budget, ethics, priorities). The system is intended as a decision-support tool to explore "what if" scenarios (e.g., different climate futures, different conservation plans) and provide prioritized, actionable recommendations.

**High-level flow**

Raw inputs (artifact metadata, baseline condition images, microclimate / scenario selection)
→ Environmental Agent (EA)
→ Material Degradation Agent (MDA)
→ AI-Driven Digital Restoration Agent (DRA)
→ Physical Intervention Agent (PIA)
→ Prioritization & Simulation Agent (PSA)
→ Outputs: prioritized intervention plan, virtually restored image(s), time-series degradation forecasts, cost estimates.

**Agent specifications**
1. Environmental Agent (EA)

Role: Input provider for environmental forcing and long-term environmental simulation.
Inputs: IPCC scenario parameters (or other climate model output), historical microclimate data, pollution models, site metadata (geolocation, indoor/outdoor, exposure).
Outputs: Time-series environmental variables T(t) (temperature), H(t) (relative humidity), C(t) (pollutant concentration), resolution configurable (e.g., hourly, daily).
Methods: Downscaling of climate scenarios, microclimate interpolation, pollutant accumulation modeling. Outputs are written to the shared session state for use by MDA.

2. Material Degradation Agent (MDA)

Role: Simulate physical and chemical deterioration from EA outputs.
Inputs: T(t), H(t), C(t), artifact materials and stratigraphy metadata, baseline condition imagery.
Outputs: Quantified damage metrics (percentage paint loss, crack length/depth, pigment fade percentages, biological growth risk), a time-indexed degradation record, and a 'Degraded State' image representing the artifact after the projection horizon (e.g., 50 years).
Methods: Uses chemical kinetics (Arrhenius), salt crystallization models, moisture cycling stress models, biological growth probability models, and mapping functions that translate calculated physical damage to image-level degradations (noise, texture cracks, color shifts, flaking overlays). The degraded image is generated by deterministic procedural filters and stochastic perturbations informed by the damage map.

3. AI-Driven Digital Restoration Agent (DRA)

Role: Produce a virtual restoration of the degraded image and quantify visual improvement.
Inputs: 'Degraded State' image from MDA, optionally original baseline image(s), restoration constraints (e.g., admissible reconstruction levels).
Outputs: 'Virtually Restored' image, visual improvement metrics (PSNR, SSIM, perceptual similarity metrics), and an uncertainty/confidence map.
Methods / Models: GANs, diffusion models, inpainting networks, vision transformers, or hybrid architectures trained or fine-tuned on restoration/inpainting datasets. The agent computes PSNR / SSIM relative to baseline where appropriate and/or uses no-reference perceptual metrics if no ground truth exists.

4. Physical Intervention Agent (PIA)

Role: Model interventions, costs, and long-term effectiveness on decay rates.
Inputs: Damage report from MDA (extent, type, priority zones), artifact metadata, available conservation methods database.
Outputs: Candidate intervention plans with itemized cost estimates (e.g., $/m² or $/hour), estimated reduction in future decay rates (ΔR_decay) and expected longevity of effect, and per-action constraints (reversibility, risk level).
Methods: Matches damage types to interventions (e.g., consolidation for flaking, desalination for salt problems, microclimate controls), uses cost models and longevity models to output how much an intervention reduces projected degradation and for how long.

5. Prioritization & Simulation Agent (PSA)

Role: Decision-making hub that optimizes combined digital and physical interventions under constraints and preferences.
Inputs: Visual improvement metric and virtually restored image from DRA; costs and effectiveness from PIA; budget and user-defined priorities (visual quality vs. stability, ethical constraints).
Outputs: Ranked/prioritized list of actionable tasks with expected benefits, costs, schedule recommendations, and scenario comparisons. Also returns alternative plans under different budget or risk tolerances.
Methods: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), integer programming, knapsack-like optimization or Pareto-front generation; supports sensitivity analysis and scenario exploration. PSA can request re-runs from other agents for alternative scenarios (e.g., "what if we apply intervention X instead of Y?").

**Ethical considerations and limitations**
Virtual restorations are reconstructions with uncertainties and must be clearly labelled as non-authentic visualizations. They should not be used as replacements for real conservation judgment.
Interventions recommended by the system are decision-support outputs and should be reviewed by qualified conservators before implementation.
Data provenance and model versioning must be maintained to ensure traceability.
Respect legal and cultural restrictions about the treatment and depiction of heritage objects.

**Extensions and future work**

Integrate more detailed spectral pigment models and multispectral imaging inputs.

Online learning: adapt degradation model parameters using observed real-world monitoring data.

Human-in-the-loop workflows with conservator annotation feedback for refinement.

Automated sensitivity analysis UI to explore trade-offs between cost, visibility, and longevity.

Integrate with facility control systems for automatic microclimate mitigation testing (simulation only; no direct actuations without human sign-off).
